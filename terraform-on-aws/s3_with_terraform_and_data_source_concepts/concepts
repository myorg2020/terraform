1. In this tutorial we are creating a s3 bucket using resource "aws_s3_bucket".
   Remember, bucket name should be unique even with 2 different accounts also.

2. using "aws_s3_object" uploads an object "finance-2020.txt" created locally in s3 bucket.

3. Now suppose there is a user's group "finance-analysts" and need to assign permission to this group to access
   the bucket, created as per point #1.

4. Here we will learn the concept of "data source". Suppose if there is any resource which is created outside of terrafrom
   i.e. manually or created by some other means but not by our terraform configuration script. So there is a way to
   include this in our terraform state file. Becoz our terraform state file is not aware about this resource as it was created
   manually earlier. So Suppose user's group "finance-analysts" is created in IAM manually. So using below code
   we can make terraform aware of this user's group "finance-analysts".

   data "aws_iam_group" "finance-data"{
     group_name = "finance-analysts"
   }

   So now terraform state file is having information about this resource.

5. Now using resource "aws_s3_bucket_policy" we have to create a Policy and assign the permission for user's group "finance-analysts"
   to s3 bucket.
