Till Now we were creating Plan by passing below 2 vars on command line:

terraform plan -out main.tfplan -var="number_of_subnets=3" -var="number_of_machines=3"

There is another Approach to do this:
1. create a file "terraform.tfvars"
2. And define these 2 vars in that file.

terraform.tfvars
================
number_of_subnets=3
number_of_machines=3

So then while running terraform plan command no need to pass vars on command line, terraform will pick it up from
terraform.tfvars file.
So, just need to run:
terraform plan -out main.tfplan
