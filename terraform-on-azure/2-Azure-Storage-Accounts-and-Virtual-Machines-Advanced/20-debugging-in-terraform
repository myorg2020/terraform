export TF_LOG="DEBUG"
export TF_LOG_PATH="/tmp/terraform.log"

when we run "terraform plan" it goes to azure and compare the states and shows lots of logs and data.
So to Refer these logs for debug purpose set above as Env var. if want to add globally as in your bashrc.

And then run "terraform plan". you will see it stores now log data in file /tmp/terraform.log

- If there is any Error coming while running "terraform apply" i.e. while creating resources.
go to Azure Portal -> Monitor (Service) -> check "Activity log"
All the operations done in Azure Portal will have under Activity Log. This is best way to check for any Error Logs.
