"Application Insights" provides features of application performance management and monitoring of live web
applications.

we have "Azure web App" -> "Application Insights" will take logs of application which is running
on Azure web App & send to "Log Analytics workspace" (Central solution for all logs).

So we need to delpoy 2 resources:
1. Log Analytics workspace
2. Application Insights
So, for this use file applicationinsights.tf and create log_analytics_workspace & application_insights with unique Names.
Mark line "workspace_id = azurerm_log_analytics_workspace.appworkspace.id" , used to connect both with each other.

Once they are connected, now we need to connect our Azure Web App with "Application Insights" which will send log to Log Analytics workspace.
manually we do this way, go to Azure Web App -> Configuration -> Under App settings we can add "Application Insights" related strings and also we can add SQL database related connection strings.
To do this using Terraform - This will be done by lines "app_settings" which we have added in webapp.tf

After these are created, go to your Azure Web App & also Explore created "Log Analytics workspace" & "Application Insights", go to Metrics section and explore, we can see logs are on.
Azure Web App -> Application Insights , it will show as "Application Insights is linked through Instrumentation Key in app settings"
Azure Web App -> Configuration -> Application Settings , it will show "APPINSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATIONKEY" & "APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING"
