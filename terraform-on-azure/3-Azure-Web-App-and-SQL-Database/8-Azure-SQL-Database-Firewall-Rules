In the section "7-Azure-SQL-Database" we hae seen to create a "SQL server" first & then create a "SQL Databse".
But we were not able to conect to "SQL Databse" using "Azure Data Studio".
It's becoz we there is Firewall Rule set by default in "SQL Databe server" which doesn't allow us to connect.

When we create "SQL Databe server" & "SQL Databse" Manually from Azure Portal it gives us an option to our client IP
to "SQL Databe server" and hence we can connect.

But in last section "7-Azure-SQL-Database", we have created "SQL Databe server" & "SQL Databse" using terraform, so we have not
Provided option to add our client IP (i.e. my workstation/laptop IP) in Firewall.

So we will Add Now, See the file sqldatabase.tf , we have added a resource called "azurerm_mssql_firewall_rule".
Mark the line "start_ip_address" & "end_ip_address". It's nothing but our workstation/laptop IP.
How to get this IP i.e. our workstation/laptop IP - Just google "what is my ip".
Another way to get our workstation/laptop IP is:
Go to "SQL Database Server" in Azure which we have created as "sqlserver0604202399" -> GO to Networking ->
Under Firewall Rules it will show "Add Your client IPv4 addrees (49.205.34.220)".

So this above way we can use to add our client IP in Firewall to allow to connect to SQL Database.

NOTE: There is also Another way to allow client IP in Firewall, is to create a "Service Endpoint" Link in Virtual Network
      and then add/connect this "Service Endpoint" in "SQL Database server" which we will see Later.
