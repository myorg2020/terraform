Once as we have Web App Created Successfully, in last section. It's an just a default Page which is Running.
We need to deploy a Real Application on top of this web App which is of .Net Application.

we have an application in GH:
https://github.com/myorg2020/webapp

Let's Integrate this webapp Application from Github with Azure Web App. In this GH webapp in the file - webapp/Pages/Index.cshtml
we have web content as "Using Azure Web Apps". So, once this GH webapp is integrated with Azure Web Apps, we should be able to see
the web Page content as "Using Azure Web Apps".

Use below files to integrate GH webapp with Azure Web Apps.
once completed then go to Azure Web App and in overview page look for "Default domain".
We will get something like: companyapp00110000.azurewebsites.net
Browse this in browser, we will see web Page content as "Using Azure Web Apps".
